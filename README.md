## How to reuse
* Go to your repo. Make a new branch called "gh-pages".
* Make sure you remove all the files that were in that folder â€” but the .git folder.
* Copy everything from this gh-pages folder into your gh-pages branch
* Go to "settings" and make sure your gh-pages branch is set as github page (you will also find your url here).
* Fiddle with the html and css and party!

### Help, I can't set my gh-pages branch as github page!
Ask your coach or an other owner of your repo to do it for you.

### Help, my css doesn't work when I copy everything!
You might have kept the gitignore file. That's okay, just make sure you open it and remove the "css" folder, because it's ignoring the files...
